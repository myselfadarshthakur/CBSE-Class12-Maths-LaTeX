    \item There are $n$ points on a circle, find the number of\\
    (i) triangles which can be formed\\
    (ii) lines which can be formed

\section*{Combinations}

A combination is a grouping or selection of different objects taken some or all at a time. $nCr$ represents the total combinations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ $(r \leq n)$ at a time.

Total combinations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ at a time is:
\[
nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Also,
\[
nC_0 = 1 = nC_n \qquad nC_1 = n = nC_{n-1} \qquad nC_2 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = nC_{n-2}
\]
\[
nCr = nC_{n-r},\qquad nCp = nCq \implies p=q \text{ or } p+q = n
\]
\[
nCr + nC_{r+1} = n+1Cr
\]
